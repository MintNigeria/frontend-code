This service validates an individual's academic and/or professional certificates/certifications to employers, background screeners, and others requiring confirmation of these data elements for employment or educational purposes, given that the individual is 18 years of age or older. Verification is conducted with the explicit consent of the individual or, if the individual is below 18 years old, with the consent of their parent or guardian. During these verifications, VAC utilizes student Data provided by partner institutions, to whom we are an authorized partner, solely for the purpose of certificate verification.  </li>

Any changes in our approach to processing student transcripts will be communicated through notifications on our Website or Application. </li>
